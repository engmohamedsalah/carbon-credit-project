# Project Proposal Analysis: Carbon Credit Verification SaaS Application

## Overview
The proposal outlines a cloud-based SaaS platform for carbon credit verification that leverages satellite imagery, explainable AI, blockchain, and IoT integration. The project aims to address the limitations of traditional verification methods by creating a more transparent, scalable, and trustworthy system.

## Key Components

### 1. AI-Powered Satellite Imagery Analysis
- Uses Sentinel-2 satellite images (10m resolution)
- Employs supervised ML models (U-Net or Random Forest) for land cover classification
- Applies biomass estimation equations to calculate carbon sequestration/loss

### 2. Explainable AI (XAI)
- Implements feature importance for tree-based models
- Uses Class Activation Maps for deep learning models
- Focuses on visual interpretation of model decisions
- Aims to build user trust in AI verification processes

### 3. Blockchain-Based Transparency
- Utilizes Ethereum or Hyperledger
- Timestamps model outputs and verification results
- Creates immutable audit trails
- Prevents tampering of carbon credit data

### 4. IoT Sensor Integration (Optional)
- Integrates with field sensors (soil moisture, temperature, biomass)
- Provides cross-validation of satellite observations
- Supports hybrid MRV systems

### 5. SaaS Interface
- User-friendly dashboard
- Project area selection/upload
- Carbon estimation maps and change reports
- Blockchain-certified verification reports
- Multiple user roles (developers, validators, government reviewers)

## Technical Stack
- **Satellite Imagery**: Sentinel-2 via Copernicus or Earth Engine
- **AI Models**: Python + PyTorch (U-Net, Random Forest)
- **XAI**: SHAP, LIME, CAM
- **Backend**: FastAPI / Django
- **Frontend**: React + Leaflet.js or Mapbox
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (via Infura) or Hyperledger Fabric
- **IoT Integration**: MQTT / REST APIs + Raspberry Pi sensor kits
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geospatial data
- **Deployment**: Docker + AWS/GCP (Cloud Run or ECS)

## Ethical and Regulatory Considerations
- Data privacy compliance (GDPR)
- Bias mitigation through diverse training datasets
- Transparency in calculations and results
- Responsible AI use with uncertainty highlighting

## Timeline
The proposal outlines an 8-week development plan:
1. Literature review & dataset finalization
2-3. Satellite data preprocessing & model exploration
4-5. Model training & XAI setup
6. Blockchain module & IoT mock implementation
7. Dashboard UI & model integration
8. Testing, documentation & write-up

## Evaluation Metrics

- Carbon estimation error margin
- User trust rating based on XAI explanations
- System latency
- Blockchain integrity

## Expected Outcomes
- Functional web-based SaaS prototype
- Tested AI model for forest change detection
- Visual XAI reports
- Blockchain-secured verification records
- Optional IoT integration
