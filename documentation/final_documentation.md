# Carbon Credit Verification SaaS Application - Final Documentation

## Project Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Carbon Credit Verification SaaS application, developed based on the literature review "AI Carbon Credit Verification: Opportunities, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations" and the project proposal "Carbon Credit Verification SaaS Application."

The application leverages artificial intelligence, satellite imagery analysis, and blockchain technology to create a transparent, reliable system for verifying carbon credits. It incorporates human-in-the-loop verification to ensure accuracy and ethical oversight, while using blockchain to provide immutable records of verified carbon credits.

## System Architecture

The application follows a hybrid architecture approach:

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) - chosen for its performance, async capabilities, and seamless integration with Python ML libraries
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for geospatial data handling
- **AI/ML**: Integration points for PyTorch and scikit-learn models
- **XAI Libraries**: Support for SHAP and LIME for model interpretability
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and deployment

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with Redux for state management
- **UI Components**: Material-UI for responsive design
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js with React-Leaflet for interactive maps
- **Data Visualization**: Support for D3.js and Recharts

### Blockchain
- **Platform**: Polygon (Ethereum L2) for energy efficiency and lower transaction costs
- **Smart Contracts**: Integration points for Solidity contracts
- **Interaction**: Web3 integration for blockchain communication

## Key Features

### 1. Project Management
- Create and manage carbon credit projects with geospatial boundaries
- Track project status through the verification lifecycle
- Store and visualize project metadata and carbon estimates

### 2. Satellite Imagery Analysis
- Upload and process satellite images for carbon sequestration verification
- AI-powered analysis of forest cover and land use changes
- Time-series analysis to track changes over project lifetime

### 3. Human-in-the-loop Verification
- AI-generated initial verification with confidence scores
- Human expert review interface for verification approval/rejection
- Transparent decision-making process with audit trail

### 4. Blockchain Certification
- Immutable certification of verified carbon credits on Polygon blockchain
- Tokenization of carbon credits for transparent trading
- Public verification of carbon credit authenticity

### 5. Explainable AI
- Transparent AI decision-making with visual explanations
- Confidence scores for all AI predictions
- Feature importance visualization for verification decisions

### 6. Role-based Access Control
- Project Developer role for creating and managing projects
- Verifier role for reviewing and certifying carbon credits
- Admin role for system management
- Viewer role for read-only access

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The application uses a relational database with the following core models:

1. **User**: Stores user information and role-based permissions
2. **Project**: Contains project details, geospatial boundaries, and status
3. **Verification**: Tracks verification processes, human reviews, and blockchain certification
4. **SatelliteImage**: Stores metadata and references to satellite imagery
5. **SatelliteAnalysis**: Contains AI analysis results and explanations

### API Endpoints

The backend provides RESTful API endpoints organized into the following categories:

1. **Authentication**: User registration, login, and token management
2. **Projects**: CRUD operations for carbon credit projects
3. **Verification**: Verification workflow, human review, and certification
4. **Satellite**: Image upload, analysis, and results retrieval
5. **Blockchain**: Certification, transaction status, and token verification

### Frontend Components

The React frontend is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Authentication**: Login and registration pages
2. **Dashboard**: Overview of projects and verifications
3. **Project Management**: Project creation, editing, and detail views
4. **Verification Interface**: Human review workflow and explanation visualization
5. **Blockchain Explorer**: View and verify certified carbon credits

## Ethical Considerations

The implementation addresses key ethical considerations identified in the literature review:

1. **Transparency**: XAI components provide clear explanations for all AI decisions
2. **Human Oversight**: Human-in-the-loop verification ensures ethical governance
3. **Data Sovereignty**: Framework for respecting Indigenous data rights
4. **Bias Mitigation**: System design allows for continuous monitoring and correction of biases
5. **Energy Efficiency**: Use of Polygon L2 blockchain reduces environmental impact
