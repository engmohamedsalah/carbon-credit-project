# Final Implementation Roadmap Summary

This document provides a concise roadmap summarizing the key phases and steps required to execute the implementation of the Carbon Credit Verification SaaS application, assuming the code structure and initial documentation are already in place.

**Phase 1: Setup & Preparation**

1.  **Environment Setup**: 
    *   Verify/install system dependencies (Python, Docker, Docker Compose).
    *   Install Python dependencies for backend (`requirements.txt`) and ML.
    *   Install Node.js dependencies for frontend (`npm install`).
    *   Configure necessary credentials (e.g., Copernicus Hub, DB connection if not default).
    *   *(Reference: Verification Checklist - Section 1)*

2.  **Data Acquisition & Preparation**: 
    *   Define Area(s) of Interest (AOI).
    *   Acquire Sentinel-2 and Hansen Global Forest Change data for AOIs.
    *   Organize data into the expected directory structure (`ml/data/...`).
    *   Perform necessary preprocessing (masking, reprojection, resampling).
    *   Adapt `ForestChangeDataset` in `ml/training/train_forest_change.py` if needed.
    *   *(Reference: Implementation Guide - Section 1.1; Verification Checklist - Section 2; Troubleshooting - Section 2)*

**Phase 2: Machine Learning Model Training**

1.  **Execute Training Script**: 
    *   Navigate to `ml/training`.
    *   Run `python train_forest_change.py`.
2.  **Monitor & Verify**: 
    *   Observe console output for loss reduction and successful completion.
    *   Ensure `forest_change_unet.pth` is saved in `ml/models/`.
    *   *(Reference: Detailed Model Training Process (Step 003); Verification Checklist - Section 3; Troubleshooting - Section 3)*

**Phase 3: SaaS Application Deployment (Local)**

1.  **Configure Model Access**: 
    *   Ensure the backend container can access `forest_change_unet.pth` (via Dockerfile `COPY` or `docker-compose.yml` volume mount).
2.  **Build & Start Services**: 
    *   Navigate to `docker` directory.
    *   Run `docker-compose up --build -d`.
3.  **Verify Container Status**: 
    *   Use `docker-compose ps` to check if `db`, `backend`, `frontend` are `Up`.
    *   Check logs (`docker-compose logs <service_name>`) for errors.
    *   *(Reference: SaaS Deployment Procedure (Step 004); Verification Checklist - Section 4; Troubleshooting - Section 4)*

**Phase 4: System Verification & Testing**

1.  **API & Frontend Access**: 
    *   Verify backend API docs (`http://<host>:8000/docs`).
    *   Verify frontend application (`http://<host>:3000`).
2.  **End-to-End Workflow Test**: 
    *   Follow the core workflow steps: User Registration -> Login -> Project Creation -> Data Input -> Verification Trigger -> Results Display -> Human Review -> Blockchain Certification -> Certificate Display.
    *   Use the detailed checklist to ensure each step functions correctly.
    *   *(Reference: Implementation Verification Checklist (Step 005) - Sections 5, 6, 7, 8; Troubleshooting - Section 5)*

**Phase 5: Iteration & Refinement**

1.  **Troubleshooting**: Address any issues encountered during verification using the troubleshooting guide.
2.  **Refinement**: Based on testing, refine code, configuration, or model as needed.

This roadmap provides a high-level overview. Refer to the detailed guides created previously for specific commands, code examples, and in-depth explanations for each step.
