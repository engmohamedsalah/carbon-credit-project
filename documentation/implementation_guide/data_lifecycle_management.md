## Data Lifecycle Management Strategy for Carbon Credit Verification SaaS

Effective data lifecycle management (DLM) is crucial for controlling costs, ensuring compliance, and maintaining the performance of the Carbon Credit Verification SaaS application, especially given the potentially large volumes of satellite imagery and ML-generated data.

### 1. Purpose

This document outlines the strategy for managing data from its creation or acquisition through processing, storage, use, archiving, and eventual deletion.

### 2. Data Types and Sources

The primary data types involved are:

-   **User Data**: Account information (email, name, hashed password), roles. Stored in PostgreSQL.
-   **Project Data**: Project details (name, description), geographic boundaries (GeoJSON/PostGIS geometry), owner information, status. Stored in PostgreSQL.
-   **Satellite Imagery**: Raw and processed satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2 GeoTIFFs). Acquired from providers (e.g., Copernicus Hub) or uploaded by users. Stored in object storage (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO).
-   **ML Training Data**: Prepared image patches and corresponding labels (e.g., Hansen data). Stored potentially in object storage or a dedicated file system during training.
-   **ML Models**: Trained model files (e.g., `.pth` files). Stored in object storage or a model registry.
-   **Verification Data**: Verification request details, status, timestamps. Stored in PostgreSQL.
-   **ML Inference Results**: Output prediction masks (GeoTIFFs), confidence maps, calculated metrics (e.g., forest loss area, carbon impact estimates), XAI visualizations. Stored in object storage, with key metrics potentially also in PostgreSQL.
-   **Blockchain Data**: Transaction hashes, certificate IDs, links to metadata. Stored in PostgreSQL for quick reference; the source of truth is the blockchain itself.
-   **Metadata**: JSON files describing blockchain certificates. Stored on IPFS or persistent object storage.
-   **Application Logs**: System and error logs. Stored temporarily on disk, then aggregated in a central logging system (e.g., ELK stack, CloudWatch).

### 3. Storage Strategy

A tiered storage approach is recommended, balancing access speed and cost:

-   **Hot Storage (Fast Access, Higher Cost)**:
    -   **PostgreSQL Database**: For structured data requiring frequent access and transactional integrity (User, Project, Verification metadata, key results).
    -   **Object Storage (Standard Tier - e.g., S3 Standard, MinIO)**: For recently acquired satellite imagery, active ML models, recent verification results, and blockchain metadata needing frequent access.
-   **Warm Storage (Moderate Access, Lower Cost)**:
    -   **Object Storage (Infrequent Access Tier - e.g., S3 Standard-IA)**: For processed satellite imagery from completed verifications, older verification results, historical ML models. Data is still readily accessible but at a lower cost.
-   **Cold Storage (Slow Access, Lowest Cost)**:
    -   **Object Storage (Archive Tier - e.g., S3 Glacier, S3 Glacier Deep Archive)**: For archiving raw satellite data from old projects, very old verification results, or data required for long-term compliance but rarely accessed. Retrieval times can range from minutes to hours.
    -   **IPFS**: For permanent, immutable storage of blockchain certificate metadata.

### 4. Data Flow and Processing

1.  **Acquisition/Upload**: Raw satellite imagery is downloaded or uploaded, initially stored in Hot Object Storage.
2.  **ML Preprocessing**: Data is prepared for ML; intermediate files might be generated and stored temporarily.
3.  **ML Inference**: Model predicts changes; results (masks, metrics) are generated. Key metrics stored in PostgreSQL, detailed results (images, maps) stored in Hot Object Storage.
4.  **Verification Review**: Human reviewers access results from Hot Storage.
5.  **Certificate Issuance**: Metadata JSON is generated and stored on IPFS/Hot Object Storage; link stored on-chain; transaction details stored in PostgreSQL.
6.  **Reporting**: Users access project/verification data primarily from PostgreSQL and recent results from Hot Object Storage.

### 5. Access Control

-   Access to data will be governed by the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system detailed previously.
-   **PostgreSQL**: Row-level security is implicitly handled by API logic checking user roles and project ownership.
-   **Object Storage**: Use signed URLs or temporary credentials generated by the backend API to grant time-limited access to specific data objects (e.g., allowing a user to download their verification results). Avoid direct user access to storage buckets.
-   **Logging System**: Access restricted to Administrators.

### 6. Retention Policies

Retention periods should be defined based on business needs, user agreements, and regulatory requirements. Example policy:

-   **User Data**: Retained as long as the account is active. Anonymized or deleted upon user request or after a period of inactivity (e.g., 2 years), subject to legal holds.
-   **Project Data**: Retained while the project is active. Moved to archive status after project completion/inactivity.
-   **Raw Satellite Imagery**: Moved to Warm/Cold Storage after verification completion (e.g., after 6 months in Hot Storage). Retained for a defined period (e.g., 5-7 years) for auditability, then potentially deleted.
-   **ML Inference Results**: Detailed results (images) moved to Warm/Cold Storage similar to raw imagery. Key metrics in PostgreSQL retained longer.
-   **Verification Records (PostgreSQL)**: Retained for a long period (e.g., 10+ years) for audit trails, potentially anonymizing user links after account deletion.
-   **Blockchain Data/Metadata**: Considered permanent due to the nature of blockchain and IPFS.
-   **Application Logs**: Rotated frequently (e.g., daily). Aggregated logs retained for a shorter period (e.g., 30-90 days) for debugging, then archived or deleted.

### 7. Archiving Procedures

-   Implement automated scripts or use object storage lifecycle policies to transition data between storage tiers (Hot -> Warm -> Cold) based on age or access patterns.
-   Example: Configure S3 Lifecycle rules to move objects from Standard to Standard-IA after 180 days, and then to Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.
-   Ensure metadata in PostgreSQL is updated to reflect the archived location of associated files if necessary, or design queries to handle potential retrieval delays from cold storage.

### 8. Deletion Procedures

-   **User-Initiated Deletion**: Implement functionality for users to delete their projects (soft delete initially, hard delete after a grace period or upon request).
-   **Admin-Initiated Deletion**: Allow administrators to delete user accounts or projects based on policy or request.
-   **Automated Deletion**: Use object storage lifecycle policies to automatically delete data from Cold Storage after the defined retention period expires.
-   **Secure Deletion**: Ensure deletion methods overwrite data or use cryptographic erasure where necessary, especially for sensitive information.
-   **Database Cleanup**: Implement procedures to periodically clean up orphaned records or data related to deleted entities.

### 9. Backup and Recovery

-   **PostgreSQL**: Implement regular automated backups (e.g., daily full backups, continuous archiving/Point-in-Time Recovery - PITR). Store backups securely and test recovery procedures periodically.
-   **Object Storage**: Enable versioning on buckets to protect against accidental deletion or overwrites. Consider cross-region replication for disaster recovery.
-   **ML Models**: Ensure trained models are backed up.
-   **Configuration**: Backup application configuration files and environment variables.

### 10. Compliance Considerations

-   **GDPR/CCPA**: If handling personal data of EU/California residents, ensure compliance with data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure). Design data structures to facilitate these requests.
-   **Data Sovereignty**: Be aware of any legal requirements regarding the geographic location where data is stored, especially for international projects.
-   **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of data access, modification, and deletion for compliance and security audits.

This DLM strategy provides a framework for managing data effectively. Specific retention periods and implementation details should be finalized based on detailed requirements and cost analysis.
