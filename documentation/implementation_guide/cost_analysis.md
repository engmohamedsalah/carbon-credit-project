This document provides a framework for estimating and optimizing costs for running the Carbon Credit Verification SaaS application in a production environment. The analysis focuses primarily on AWS services, as they were used in the deployment examples.

## 1. Cost Components Overview

The total cost of running the application includes:

1. **Compute Resources**: EC2 instances, ECS/Fargate tasks, or EKS nodes
2. **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with PostGIS
3. **Storage**: S3 buckets for satellite imagery, ML models, and results
4. **Data Transfer**: Network traffic between components and to/from the internet
5. **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer (ALB)
6. **Container Registry**: ECR for storing Docker images
7. **Monitoring & Logging**: CloudWatch metrics, logs, alarms
8. **Blockchain Interaction**: Gas fees for transactions (external to AWS)
9. **Other AWS Services**: Secrets Manager, SNS, etc.
10. **Development & Operations**: CI/CD, testing environments, developer tools

## 2. Detailed Cost Estimation

### 2.1 Compute Resources

#### Option A: EC2 Instances

- **Backend Servers**: 2 × t3.medium instances (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM)
  - On-Demand: ~$0.0416/hour × 2 × 730 hours/month = ~$60.74/month
  - Reserved (1-year, no upfront): ~$40/month (34% savings)
- **Frontend Servers**: 2 × t3.small instances (2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM)
  - On-Demand: ~$0.0208/hour × 2 × 730 hours/month = ~$30.37/month
  - Reserved (1-year, no upfront): ~$20/month (34% savings)

#### Option B: ECS Fargate

- **Backend Tasks**: 2 tasks × (1 vCPU, 2 GB memory)
  - ~$0.04048/hour (vCPU) + ~$0.004445/hour (memory) × 2 × 730 hours = ~$65.70/month
- **Frontend Tasks**: 2 tasks × (0.5 vCPU, 1 GB memory)
  - ~$0.02024/hour (vCPU) + ~$0.002223/hour (memory) × 2 × 730 hours = ~$32.85/month
- **Savings Potential**: Fargate Savings Plans can reduce costs by up to 50%

#### Option C: EKS

- **EKS Control Plane**: $0.10/hour × 730 hours = $73/month
- **Worker Nodes**: Similar to EC2 costs above, plus potential savings with Spot Instances

### 2.2 Database (RDS PostgreSQL)

- **Instance**: db.t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) with PostGIS
  - On-Demand: ~$0.068/hour × 730 hours = ~$49.64/month
  - Reserved (1-year, no upfront): ~$32/month (35% savings)
- **Storage**: 100 GB gp2 storage at $0.115/GB-month = $11.50/month
- **Backup Storage**: Assuming 50% of DB size = $5.75/month
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Doubles the instance cost for high availability

### 2.3 Storage (S3)

- **Standard Storage**:
  - First 50 TB: $0.023/GB-month

## 5. Cost Monitoring and Governance

### 5.1 AWS Cost Explorer

- Set up AWS Cost Explorer to track and analyze costs
- Create custom reports for different components and services

### 5.2 Budgets and Alerts

- Create AWS Budgets to set spending limits
- Configure alerts for unusual spending patterns

### 5.3 Tagging Strategy

- Implement comprehensive resource tagging for cost allocation
- Tags to consider: Environment, Project, Component, Team, Cost Center

### 5.4 Regular Reviews

- Conduct monthly cost reviews
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Update resource allocations based on actual usage

## 6. Academic/Research Considerations

For dissertation projects or academic research:

- **AWS Educate/Research Credits**: Apply for AWS research credits
- **Free Tier Utilization**: Leverage AWS Free Tier services where possible
- **Scheduled Operations**: Consider running non-critical environments only during working hours
- **Simplified Architecture**: Use simpler architectures for proof-of-concept implementations

## 7. Conclusion

The estimated monthly cost for running the Carbon Credit Verification SaaS application ranges from approximately $260 to $310 for a basic production setup. Costs will vary based on actual usage patterns, data volumes, and specific architectural choices.

Implementing the cost optimization strategies outlined in this document can potentially reduce costs by 30-50% compared to the baseline estimates.

Regular monitoring, right-sizing, and leveraging AWS cost-saving options (Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, Spot Instances) are key to maintaining cost efficiency as the application scales.
