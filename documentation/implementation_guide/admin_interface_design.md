## Admin Interface Design for Carbon Credit Verification SaaS

An administrative interface is essential for managing the Carbon Credit Verification SaaS application, overseeing users, and monitoring system health. This section outlines the design and key features of the admin panel.

### 1. Goals and Target Users

-   **Goal**: Provide administrators with the tools to manage users, roles, projects, verifications, and system settings efficiently and securely.
-   **Target User**: Users with the `Administrator` role.

### 2. Access and Layout

-   **Access**: Accessible via a dedicated route (e.g., `/admin`) protected by the `Administrator` role.
-   **Layout**: A sidebar navigation layout is recommended for easy access to different sections.
    -   **Sidebar**: Links to Dashboard, User Management, Role Management, Project Oversight, Verification Oversight, System Settings, Monitoring.
    -   **Main Content Area**: Displays the content for the selected section.

### 3. Key Sections and Features

#### 3.1 Admin Dashboard

-   **Purpose**: Provide a high-level overview of system status and key metrics.
-   **Components**:
    -   **Summary Cards**: Total Users, Active Users, Total Projects, Pending Verifications, Failed Verifications, Blockchain Transactions (Last 24h).
    -   **Recent Activity Feed**: Log of important admin actions or system events (e.g., user created, role assigned, verification failed).
    -   **System Health Overview**: Quick status indicators for API, Database, ML Service, Blockchain Connection.
    -   **Quick Links**: Shortcuts to common admin tasks (e.g., Create User, View Pending Verifications).

#### 3.2 User Management

-   **Purpose**: Allow administrators to manage user accounts.
-   **Components**:
    -   **User List**: Table displaying all users with columns for ID, Email, Full Name, Roles, Status (Active/Inactive), Created At.
        -   Features: Search, Filter (by role, status), Sort, Pagination.
    -   **Actions per User**: Edit, Activate/Deactivate, Delete, Assign Roles.
    -   **Create User Form**: Modal or separate page to add new users (Email, Full Name, Password, Assign Roles).
    -   **Edit User Form**: Modal or separate page to update user details (Email, Full Name, Status, Roles). Password reset functionality might be separate.

#### 3.3 Role Management

-   **Purpose**: Allow administrators to manage roles (if dynamic role creation is needed, otherwise just view and assign).
-   **Components**:
    -   **Role List**: Table displaying available roles (ID, Name, Description).
    -   **Actions per Role**: View Users with Role, (Optional: Edit Description, Delete Role - if roles are dynamic and deletable).
    -   **(Optional) Create/Edit Role Form**: If roles are dynamic.

#### 3.4 Project Oversight

-   **Purpose**: Allow administrators to view and manage all projects in the system.
-   **Components**:
    -   **Project List**: Table displaying all projects with columns for ID, Name, Owner (User Email/Name), Status, Created At, Last Updated.
        -   Features: Search, Filter (by owner, status), Sort, Pagination.
    -   **Actions per Project**: View Details, View Verifications, (Optional: Edit Project Details, Change Owner, Delete Project - use with caution).
    -   **Project Detail View**: Read-only view of project details, map, associated data, and verification history (similar to user view but with admin context).

#### 3.5 Verification Oversight

-   **Purpose**: Allow administrators to monitor and manage verification processes.
-   **Components**:
    -   **Verification List**: Table displaying all verifications with columns for ID, Project ID/Name, Status (Pending, In Progress, Needs Review, Completed, Failed), Initiated By, Assigned Verifier (if applicable), Created At.
        -   Features: Search, Filter (by status, project, verifier), Sort, Pagination.
    -   **Actions per Verification**: View Details, View Project, Assign Verifier (if manual assignment), Re-run Failed Verification (if applicable), View Logs.
    -   **Verification Detail View**: Read-only view of verification details, ML results, review history, associated blockchain transaction (if applicable).

#### 3.6 System Settings

-   **Purpose**: Configure system-wide parameters.
-   **Components**: (Use forms to edit settings)
    -   **ML Settings**: Confidence threshold for human review, default model version.
    -   **Blockchain Settings**: RPC URL, Contract Address (display only?), Gas price strategy.
    -   **Notification Settings**: Email server configuration, notification templates.
    -   **API Settings**: Rate limits, CORS origins.

#### 3.7 Monitoring

-   **Purpose**: Provide access to system monitoring data.
-   **Components**:
    -   **Error Logs**: Interface to view and filter application error logs.
    -   **Performance Metrics**: Embed Grafana dashboards or display key metrics (API latency, error rates, resource usage).
    -   **Job Queue Status**: Monitor background task queues (e.g., Celery, RQ) if used.

### 4. UI/UX Considerations

-   **Clarity**: Use clear labels and consistent terminology.
-   **Efficiency**: Design workflows to minimize clicks for common tasks.
-   **Safety**: Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (e.g., deleting users or projects).
-   **Responsiveness**: Ensure the interface works reasonably well on different screen sizes, although desktop is the primary target.
-   **Security**: All admin actions must be protected by backend authorization checks.

### 5. Required API Endpoints (Examples)

New or modified API endpoints needed to support the admin interface:

-   `GET /api/admin/dashboard-summary`
-   `GET /api/admin/users` (with filtering/pagination)
-   `POST /api/admin/users`
-   `GET /api/admin/users/{user_id}`
-   `PUT /api/admin/users/{user_id}`
-   `DELETE /api/admin/users/{user_id}`
-   `GET /api/admin/roles`
-   `GET /api/admin/projects` (view all, with filtering/pagination)
-   `GET /api/admin/verifications` (view all, with filtering/pagination)
-   `POST /api/admin/verifications/{verification_id}/assign`
-   `GET /api/admin/settings`
-   `PUT /api/admin/settings`
-   `GET /api/admin/logs`

These endpoints must be strictly protected and only accessible to users with the `Administrator` role.

This design provides a comprehensive admin interface for managing the Carbon Credit Verification SaaS application. The specific implementation details can be refined based on the chosen frontend framework (React) and component library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design).
