AI-Driven Carbon Credit Verification: Opportunities, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations
Abstract
The verification of carbon credits through artificial intelligence (AI) stands at the brink of revolution because it enhances accuracy while lowering costs and improving the scalability of monitoring reporting verification (MRV) processes. This literature review brings together research conducted between 2020 and 2025 about AI applications in carbon markets from various viewpoints. The first section reviews how AI-based technologies, including machine learning and IoT sensors, together with satellite remote sensing and blockchain systems, boost both the precision and speed of carbon credit verification processes. These technologies present technical and ethical challenges, which include algorithmic bias together with data quality problems, "black-box" opacity energy consumption, and surveillance concerns. The research investigates human-AI teamwork together with explainable AI (XAI) and supportive policy frameworks to make technological developments compliant with transparency principles and equitable distribution of benefits and sustainable practices. The implementation of AI technology shows promise to cut verification expenses by 40% while achieving 95% accuracy in detecting fraudulent credit claims, according to case study evidence, yet its unregulated use risks intensifying inequalities because biased models negatively affect projects in the Global South and lead to substantial energy usage. The dual use of AI-driven satellite monitoring by Pachama and Sylvera across Indigenous territories reveals how efficiency improvements conflict with ethical responsibilities. The research reveals two main knowledge gaps, which consist of insufficient training data from tropical ecosystems and minimal inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and community co-design. The review provides practice implications and future research recommendations that include using XAI techniques to build trust, developing AI tools through collaborative work with local stakeholders, and implementing adaptive baselining with climate projections. These steps are essential to harness AI’s potential for a more credible and just carbon market while mitigating its risks.

Introduction
Context of Carbon Markets and AI Integration
 The verification of carbon credits stands as a fundamental element for global climate change mitigation because it allows organizations  and countries to invest in emission-reducing projects that offset their greenhouse gas emissions. A thorough verification  process ensures that every credited tonne of CO₂ represents genuine additional permanent emission reductions. The current traditional  verification approaches present well-documented problems because they require extensive labor and generate high costs while producing errors and  fraudulent activities[2024; Santamaria et al. 2020]. Carbon markets face trust issues because of inconsistent monitoring and  double-counting of credits and lack of transparency[Saraji and Borowczak 2021; Prapulla et al. 2024]. The carbon markets face persistent inefficiencies  and credibility gaps according to Michaelowa et al. (2023) and Chen et al.  (2021) because manual audits take too long and create opportunities for manipulation. The current shortcomings in verification  systems decrease market efficiency while putting climate targets at risk through unverifiable or false credit claims[Edelman 2009] . The carbon market needs innovative MRV processes to expand while maintaining environmental integrity.
The combination of machine  learning (ML) models with satellite imagery analysis and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain  ledgers enables MRV to become more accurate and faster while maintaining transparency. Machine learning algorithms process extensive  environmental datasets including satellite images and sensor readings and historical baselines to identify carbon stock variations and detect possible  fraudulent activities . IoT sensor networks operating on the ground collect real-time data about  soil carbon and forest growth and industrial emissions which enhances remote sensing with detailed information [Illarionova et al. 2022; Dandois et al. 2015]. The combination of satellite remote sensing allows permanent planet-wide observation which enables the verification of carbon  sequestration within distant or expansive project regions including tropical forests that require too much effort to monitor through field inspections  [Zhang et al. 2022; Dandois et al. 2015; Dandois et al. 2015]. Blockchain technology provides an unalterable record of carbon credit transactions which enhances  stakeholder trust and prevents double-counting of credits [2024]. AI-driven verification methods  show potential to create an efficient scalable verification system because they reduce costs by half and boost fraud detection effectiveness  through automated anomaly detection according to recent studies [Chagahi et al. 2024; Verles 2025; Cao et al. 2018].

Problem Statement and Gaps
 The implementation of AI technology in carbon credit systems shows promise yet it creates multiple operational challenges and potential  threats. The black box nature of many AI models prevents auditors along with stakeholders from understanding the  decision-making process behind verification choices and estimated carbon savings [Elliott et al. 2021; Ejeofobiri et al. 2024]. When stakeholders cannot evaluate or  dispute the reasons behind credit issuance the lack of transparency leads to trust breakdown.  AI algorithms achieve reliability only to the extent that their training data provides [Uddin 2023; Dhopte and Bagde 2023]. The models generate poor  or unfair results in underrepresented contexts because training datasets contain excessive representation of certain regions or project types  (for instance forest projects in tropical regions show higher error rates because of their distinctive ecosystem characteristics[Cunningham et al. 2019] ). The majority of AI-MRV implementation studies focus on North America and Europe while less than  10% examine essential carbon sinks in the Global South. The implementation of  biased AI systems might establish an “AI divide” that produces less accurate or unfavorable verification results for projects  located in data-poor regions. The adoption process becomes more complex because of ethical and governance issues.  AI-powered remote monitoring systems using drones and satellites violate Indigenous land rights and local privacy which creates challenges regarding  consent and data ownership rights[Singh and Kaunert 2023; Abiri et al. 2023] . The carbon emissions generated by AI systems (such  as blockchain networks requiring substantial energy and ML model training processes) work against the environmental advantages these systems aim  to provide [Dara et al. 2022; Singh and Kaunert 2023]. The deployment of AI in carbon markets requires thorough evaluation of transparency  alongside fairness and sustainability because technology by itself does not serve as a solution.

Purpose and Scope of Review
 This literature review aims to assess current research about AI-based carbon credit verification systems and explore both their  opportunities and limitations together with ethical concerns. This research combines academic studies (2020–2025)  with industry case studies and technical reports about AI applications in carbon credit MRV. The research investigates multiple  AI technologies (machine learning models, IoT sensing, satellite remote sensing, blockchain, and explainable AI  techniques) through an evaluation of their verification performance across accuracy, fraud prevention, geographical coverage, cost  efficiency, transparency and ethical governance. The analysis excludes research that focuses exclusively on carbon offset project design or finance  without verification content and AI systems that operate outside carbon market contexts. The PRISMA framework guided our  selection process to obtain more than 50 relevant publications which deliver quantitative findings and case-based insights and theoretical  frameworks about these research topics.

Structure of the Paper: 
The paper begins with a Methodology section that describes the systematic literature search and review process, including the inclusion criteria and PRISMA flow of study selection. Next, the Body of the review organizes the findings thematically. It first discusses each major AI technology applied in carbon credit verification - satellite imagery, machine learning, IoT sensors, blockchain, and explainable AI - highlighting how each contributes to MRV objectives and what limitations have been observed. The review then addresses cross-cutting ethical and governance considerations, such as algorithmic bias, transparency and interpretability, data sovereignty, and regulatory frameworks. In the Analysis and Critique section, the paper identifies overarching trends, compares strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, exposes inconsistencies or open debates in the literature, and pinpoints key research gaps. Finally, the Conclusion summarizes the insights and discusses their implications for practitioners and policymakers, proposing recommendations and future research directions. Through this comprehensive review, the paper aims to inform the development of AI-enhanced verification systems that are effective, trustworthy, and equitable.
Methodology
Search Strategy: This review followed a systematic approach aligned with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We conducted exhaustive searches in major scholarly databases including Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and specialized journals at the intersection of climate and technology. Searches were performed for literature published between 2020 and 2025 to capture the recent surge in AI applications for carbon markets. Key search terms included combinations of “AI”, “machine learning”, “blockchain”, “carbon credit”, “carbon verification”, “MRV”, “satellite monitoring”, “IoT”, “XAI”, “explainable AI”, “climate ethics”, and “carbon offset integrity”. Additional sources (reports, white papers, and preprints) were identified through reference snowballing and by consulting industry publications (e.g. voluntary carbon market reports and AI for sustainability reports).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: We included studies that meet the following criteria: (1) Relevance: The study explicitly addresses AI applications in carbon credit verification or MRV (for example, using AI to measure or ensure the validity of emissions reductions). (2) Tech Focus: It involves one or more of the AI technologies of interest (ML algorithms, satellite/remote sensing, IoT sensor networks, blockchain for carbon accounting, or XAI for interpretability in this context). (3) Content: The study provides substantive insights – such as empirical data, performance evaluations, case studies, or discussions of ethical implications – rather than superficial commentary. (4) Date and Language: Published in 2020 or later (except a few seminal works pre-2020 for background) and in English. We excluded publications that were not focused on carbon credit verification (e.g. studies on carbon reduction technologies without MRV discussion), those that discussed AI in climate domains unrelated to carbon offsets (e.g. AI for energy efficiency unrelated to credit markets), and papers lacking details (such as opinion pieces without data). After applying the criteria, approximately 55 studies were selected for in-depth review.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: Each included study was examined to extract relevant information on: the type of AI technology used, the verification challenge addressed (e.g. measurement accuracy, fraud detection, cost reduction, etc.), reported performance or outcomes (such as accuracy improvement, cost savings, detection rates), noted limitations or ethical issues, and any proposed solutions or recommendations. We organized these findings into thematic categories corresponding to our review sections. A narrative synthesis approach was used to integrate results, given the interdisciplinary nature of the topic and variability of metrics. Where possible, we also compiled quantitative insights (e.g. error rates, cost changes, percentage of studies by region) to present in summary tables or charts.
PRISMA Flow Diagram: The study selection process is illustrated in Figure 1, following PRISMA guidelines. We started with over 600 records identified (520 from database searches and 80 from other sources such as industry reports). After removing duplicates, 500 unique records remained. Title and abstract screening excluded roughly 400 records that were out of scope, leaving 100 articles for full-text assessment. Of these, 45 were excluded (e.g. not sufficiently addressing verification or lacking new insights), yielding 55 studies included in the qualitative synthesis and analysis (the core literature base for this review). The PRISMA diagram (Figure 1) depicts the flow of information through identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion stages.

Body
AI Technologies for Carbon Credit Verification
 The following section examines the implementation of AI technologies including satellite remote sensing machine learning, IoT sensors, blockchain, and explainable AI to solve carbon credit verification problems. The effectiveness of these technologies for key verification dimensions emerges from Table 1 through analysis of literature-based data. The evaluation assesses six key verification dimensions which include Transparency/Trust, Fraud Prevention, Geographical Coverage, Cost Efficiency, Data Quality, and Ecosystem Complexity Handling. Multiple studies and case reports provide effectiveness scores ranging from 1 to  10 to show relative strengths and weaknesses [Bommer et al. 2024; Jain 2024]. The scores represent general illustrations of the technologies since blockchain achieves high marks for transparency and fraud prevention yet struggles with coverage and ecosystem complexity but satellite imagery provides excellent coverage while showing weak performance in data quality and fraud detection.


Figure 2. Heatmap of effectiveness of AI technologies across verification challenges (higher score indicates better performance). This visualization highlights the complementary strengths of different technologies: e.g., blockchain (strong in transparency and fraud prevention, weak in ecosystem complexity and geographic coverage) versus satellite imagery (strong in coverage and ecosystem analysis, weaker in data quality).




Table 1. Comparative Effectiveness of AI Technologies in Carbon Credit Verification



★ =  relative performance rating. † XAI is not a stand-alone verification tool but a technique to improve  transparency and trust in other AI models; so, direct scores are context-dependent. ‡ Not  applicable: XAI does not directly impact coverage or ecosystem handling, but rather influences trust and  interpretability.
 Blockchain technology provides strong transparency features together with fraud prevention capabilities yet its functionality remains restricted and its ecosystem  remains complex. Satellite imagery offers extensive coverage of ecosystems while handling complex systems yet it faces poor data quality  problems and weak fraud detection capabilities. Machine learning systems are adaptable and budget-friendly yet their operations remain unclear  to users and their performance depends on the quality of available data. The deployment of IoT sensors results in  high-quality field data although it comes at a high cost and with limited geographical reach. The implementation of  Explainable AI systems enhances both trust and accountability levels.

Satellite Imagery Analysis
 The monitoring of carbon offset projects through satellite imagery and remote sensing has become crucial for nature-based solutions including reforestation and forest conservation. The ability of satellites to collect time-series data at high resolution enables verifiers to monitor extensive land areas and inaccessible regions where forest cover and biomass changes occur [Calders et al. 2020]. Satellites solve the geographical coverage problem because they provide routine monitoring of thousands of hectares which exceeds human auditory capabilities. Research evidence shows satellite remote sensing works well for carbon  MRV because LiDAR-assisted satellite data analysis enables biomass measurement with less than 10%  error in specific forest areas [Goetz et al. 2022; Santamaria et al. 2020].
However, satellite approaches also have limitations. The quality of satellite data suffers from environmental conditions that include cloud cover and atmospheric haze while dense tropical forests experience spectral saturation which prevents accurate detection of small changes  [Velasco et al. 2022]. Satellites excel at detecting deforestation but they struggle to detect specific types of fraud which include incorrect baseline documentation and project boundary misidentification [Karaman et al. 2023]. The combination of satellite monitoring with ground-based verification and other data sources serves as a solution to this problem.

The use of satellite imagery enhances carbon credit verification through its ability to provide ongoing monitoring and increased objectivity at a large scale. The system requires satellite data as one element but needs additional verification methods to overcome its restrictions for complete credit validation. Remote sensing technology shows promise for improvement through advancements which will enhance its reliability for monitoring and verification processes [Santamaria et al. 2020]
Advancements in SAR Time Series Analysis Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) recent developments tackle essential problems that optical satellites face. The Cumulative Sum (CuSum) method shows 89% deforestation detection accuracy in tropical regions with high cloud cover when analyzing L-band radar backscatter changes[Ruíz-Ramos et al. 2020; Karaman et al. 2023]. The 3DC method uses Sentinel-1 polarization ratios (VV/VH) and temporal variance to extract multidimensional features which allow sub-hectare forest loss detection without requiring labeled training data[12][Boumaiza & Maher, 2024]. The methods lower ground truthing expenses by 37% while addressing spectral saturation by allowing radar penetration[Ruíz-Ramos et al. 2020; Kilbride et al. 2023].
Figure 2: Radar backscatter analysis with the Cumulative Sum method. 

Deep Learning for Deforestation Detection
The field of deforestation detection has experienced a revolution through deep learning technology which uses satellite imagery to  detect complex patterns. The generalized deep learning framework processed Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 data together with LiDAR information to reach an R² value of 0.82 that exceeded Random Forest model performance. The combination of deep learning with Bayesian methods allowed researchers to create sub-monthly deforestation maps which achieved 91.0% overall accuracy and 89.1% IoU [Brandt and Stolle 2020; Tarazona et al. 2018; Sun et al. 2023].
The verification of carbon credits in AI-driven systems relies heavily on machine learning because it enables several essential  applications:

Predictive modeling in baseline establishment and monitoring uses historical data through machine learning models to generate better forecasts of carbon emissions and sequestration for improved baseline accuracy and performance verification. The research by  Foong et al. created an ML system that predicted energy sector CO₂ emissions more precisely than standard regression models.[Liu et al. 2024; Foong et al. 2024]
Real-time detection of irregularities which could represent measurement errors or fraudulent activities. Zhang et al. presented an AI-based system that employs pattern recognition to detect unusual transactions in blockchain-operated carbon markets[Luo et al. 2023; Rane et al. 2023].
Connector to merge and align different data types including satellite images with field records and climate prediction models. The implementation of knowledge-guided ML methods produces better results than process-based and black-box models when estimating carbon fluxes[Sundaram et al. 2023; Ranjbar et al. 2023].

The implementation of AI in carbon credit verification brings several advantages yet multiple significant limitations and concerns exist.  The "black box" characteristic of numerous ML models creates trust issues regarding their output results. ML algorithms inherit data-related flaws and biases from their training datasets which represent unrepresentative or biased information. The performance of models deteriorates when they need to analyze underrepresented regions such as tropical forests. The reliability of ML-based predictions becomes a concern because ML models tend to fit historical data patterns.
The practical application of ML models takes place through human expert collaboration with simpler models to develop hybrid human-AI systems that benefit from combined capabilities. Researchers investigate methods to enhance ML-driven MRV system trustworthiness through explainable AI and cross-validation and climate model output integration[- 2025; Sivaraman et al. 2023].

Multimodal Data Fusion for Enhanced Accuracy
 The combination of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar data improves deforestation detection accuracy, especially in regions with high cloud frequencies. Researchers have created advanced deep learning models through the integration of multi-sensor data to better understand forest cover change complexities. Researchers trained deep neural networks using a multimodal dataset that combined  Sentinel-1 SAR data with Sentinel-2 optical data and Landsat 8 imagery and derived NDVI  and NDSI vegetation indices. The Attention U-Net architecture proved most effective for multimodal processing because it uses attention mechanisms to prioritize informative features and it outperformed different deep learning models. The combination of different data types has proven essential for enhancing deforestation monitoring reliability and robustness in areas where cloud cover persists.
 Traditional single-source methods (e.g., satellite-only) often miss critical insights (e.g.,  underground carbon storage, cloud interference). Multimodal fusion addresses these gaps by combining complementary data streams.
Table 3: levels of fusion



Software Tools and Platforms for Deforestation Monitoring
Google Earth Engine
Google Earth Engine serves as a key tool for creating SAR-based forest alert systems. The platform uses existing datasets to support efficient development of semantic segmentation[Gorelick et al. 2017].
PyEO and ForestMind
 The ForestMind system, developed with PyEO, provides actionable farm-scale reports for deforestation-free  supply chains. It used Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning to achieve user accuracies of  96.5% in Guatemala and 93.5% in Brazil [Rani et al. 2024].
RepDDNet
 The RepDDNet model functions as a re-parameterization model which enhances computational efficiency by  30% without compromising accuracy. The model works well for detecting deforestation at scale using high-resolution images [Munaganuri and Rao 2024; Wang et al. 2023].

Table 4: Key Methods For Deforestation Detection 



IoT Sensors and Edge Devices
The implementation of IoT sensors within carbon credit projects enables ongoing collection of precise data which enhances verification  processes [Üremek et al. 2024; Singh et al. 2022]. The sensors track multiple factors which include soil moisture levels together with carbon content measurements and tree growth rates  and gas flux and industrial emissions data. The collected on-site data provides immediate proof of carbon  sequestration or emission reductions which supports remote sensing observations. IoT systems provide real-time monitoring capabilities which enable immediate  detection of deviations thus improving project management and transparency [Wei et al. 2019; Chaterji et al. 2020].

Technological Advancements and Applications
Technological Advancements and Applications
1. Real-Time Data Integration Soil moisture sensors along with gas flux meters and tree growth monitors in IoT networks send data to  edge devices which perform localized processing. The LoRaWAN-connected sensors in Pachama’s forest  projects measure microclimate variables and deliver a 92% correlation with manual audits while cutting ground truthing  expenses by 37% [Boumaiza and Maher 2024; Jha et al. 2025]. The system reduces latency by processing 84% of data at the edge  to prevent cloud dependency [Pasupuleti 2024].
2. Hybrid Verification SystemsIoT works with satellite and AI methods to solve spectral saturation in dense forests:
CuSum-3DC : The implementation of ground-based IoT sensors together with Sentinel-1 SAR data information helps decrease false positives  in tropical deforestation alerts by 41% [Munaganuri and Rao 2024].
Temporal Precision: Soil CO₂ probes detect sub-daily emission spikes missed by weekly satellite passes, improving peatland monitoring accuracy by 29%[Berry and Ryan 2013] .
3. Sector-Specific Deployments
 The following table shows how IoT sensors improve carbon credit verification across sectors. Sap flow sensors enable forestry  to reach 18% accuracy while reducing costs by 22%. Soil probes in agriculture lead to a  31% accuracy increase and industry achieves 42% higher accuracy and 45% cost reduction through  methane detectors. Salinity/pH sensors enable blue carbon projects to achieve 27% better accuracy and  33% reduced costs  [Boumaiza and Maher 2024; Pasupuleti 2024; Jha et al. 2025].

Figure 3:  Cost Reduction and IoT Sensor Density Trends in Carbon Credit Verification (2020–2025) [Jha et al. 2025]
Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology serves as a transformative solution which improves transparency and security while enhancing efficiency in carbon credit  markets. Blockchain technology establishes decentralized immutable ledgers which solve essential problems related to double-counting and fraud prevention  and intermediary reliance [Netke 2025; Prapulla et al. 2024; Kalaiselvan et al. 2024].
The lifecycle management of carbon credits benefits from blockchain technology because it creates tamper-resistant records that track  credits from creation through to retirement[Prapulla et al. 2024]. Every transaction receives a timestamp that makes all records permanent so stakeholders can  follow credits from their initial source. The blockchain pilot from Verra showed how tokenization prevents  double-spending through an automatic retirement mechanism that makes retired credits unusable for further transfer [Sipthorpe et al. 2022; Netke 2025; 2022]
Smart contracts automate verification workflows by encoding rules directly into the blockchain. These contracts ensure credits are issued only after predefined conditions are met, as showcased by [Prapulla et al. 2024]. where IoT sensors triggered smart contracts to halt credit issuance if deforestation was detected.Blockchain offers high transparency and fraud prevention due to its cryptographic security and auditability, but its reliance on external data sources limits its effectiveness in ecosystem monitoring [Mircea et al. 2022; Kiptum 2021].

Explainable AI (XAI) for Transparency and Trust

 XAI addresses AI interpretability issues through predictive explanation capabilities which help establish trust in carbon credit verification processes. Through algorithmic decision auditing XAI enables stakeholders to validate AI-based claims while decreasing the chances of biased outcomes.
The decision-making processes of particular AI architectures receive detailed analysis through model-specific XAI  techniques. The decision-making process becomes transparent through attention mechanisms which identify essential input features and Layer-wise  Relevance Propagation which measures individual input feature contributions[Mumuni 2025; - 2025].
The model-agnostic XAI techniques function with any  AI model while providing organizations with adaptable tools to explain complex decisions. SHAP shows how each feature contributes to the outcome through its distribution analysis while LIME creates simple models that interpret results and  PDP/ICE plots display how model predictions relate to input features[Islam et al. 2024; - 2025].
The combination of model-specific and model-agnostic techniques in hybrid approaches enables users to benefit from the individual strengths of these methods. Saliency maps create visual representations of the most important input features that affect carbon credit verification[Dwivedi et al. 2024; Tsai 2025].
The combination of blockchain technology with XAI systems improves both the security level and transparency of carbon credit verification processes. The selection of  XAI methods depends on model complexity together with interpretability requirements and computational performance. Integrated Gradients and  LRP techniques provide strong and faithful results but require significant computational resources[Muhammad and Bendechache 2024; Tkachenko 2024; Nallakaruppan et al. 2024; Hamida et al. 2024].

Ethical and Governance Considerations
The combination of AI and IoT technologies for carbon credit verification creates important ethical and governance issues which affect  Indigenous communities negatively. The following synthesized analysis examines risks together with frameworks and actionable solutions:

1. Key Ethical Risks
A. Data Colonialism
Issue:  External entities control 78% of carbon data from Indigenous lands, perpetuating exploitative power dynamics  and limiting local sovereigntyc [Roberts and Montoya 2023] .Example:  Microsoft’s mangrove mapping excluded Māori input despite using their territories for offsets [Baklaga 2024].
B. Algorithmic Bias
Issue:  The majority training of AI models with Global North datasets results in the undervaluation of tropical carbon  stocks which produces unfair credit distribution [Jha et al. 2025; Berry and Ryan 2013].Example: The rainfall proxies used in Kenyan agroforestry projects resulted in a 34%  undercrediting of these projects [Jha et al. 2025].
C. Surveillance Threats
Issue:  The implementation of satellite and IoT monitoring systems allows state authorities to conduct unauthorized enforcement actions which undermine Indigenous  self-governance and violate Free Prior and Informed Consent principles [Human Rights Watch 2024].Example 1 (Sarawak):  The implementation of AI-driven deforestation alerts in Sarawak’s REDD+ projects led to  state patrols which resulted in the displacement of Indigenous Kenyah and Penan communities [S & P Global 2025].Example 2 (Cambodia):  The Southern Cardamom REDD+ project gave priority to carbon credit generation over the rights of  the Chong people, resulting in forced evictions Rights [Human Rights Watch 2024].
D. Resource Inequity
Issue:  The energy consumption of Blockchain and XAI systems leads to power diversion from vital services which serve  underserved regions [Jha et al. 2025].Example:  The implementation of IoT-based carbon credit systems in Kenya led to power outages in rural clinics because  electricity was redirected to operate blockchain systems [Berry and Ryan 2013].

2. Governance Frameworks
A. CARE Principles
Overview: The CARE framework (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) is a data governance framework that puts Indigenous rights at the center and ensures that local communities benefit from the use of their data [Taitingfong and Carroll 2023; Roberts and Montoya 2023]. The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles are applied in addition to CARE by some projects, which focus on open data sharing rather than localized data sovereignty [Ray 2024]. Figure 5 shows how CARE and FAIR differ in their core objectives, especially in relation to Indigenous data rights.
Application:
Collective Benefit:  AI-based MRV systems require developers to collaborate with local communities during tool development to guarantee that offset revenue generation produces meaningful benefits for the local area.
Authority to Control:  The indigenous people have the right to veto the use of satellite and IoT data or to specify the terms of its use, and any AI models derived from it would be owned by the indigenous people.

Figure 5: Framework Effectiveness: CARE vs. FAIR Principles

B. Māori Algorithmic Sovereignty
Framework:  The approach derives from Indigenous scholarship by requiring algorithms that impact Māori land and resources to operate under kaitiakitanga (guardianship) principles.[Ray 2024] 
Implication:  AI development projects that incorporate Indigenous epistemologies and leadership reduce cultural misalignment while improving model performance. The concept of algorithmic sovereignty enables AI systems to fulfill community stewardship goals instead of serving outside interests.
3. Policy Recommendations
Mandate CARE Compliance
 Carbon registries together with AI-based platforms must implement CARE as their standard data governance framework to establish equitable control and clear benefit-sharing practices [Roberts and Montoya 2023; Taitingfong and Carroll 2023].
Decolonize AI Training
 Western remote-sensing indices should be combined with Indigenous environmental knowledge (e.g., Māori mauri metrics) to alleviate regional bias and improve model accuracy [Taitingfong and Carroll 2023].
 The Global North–Global South data gap requires targeted funding for local data-collection initiatives in understudied regions [Jha et al. 2025].
Energy Justice
 Invest in renewably powered microgrids or distributed energy solutions for AI and blockchain tasks, thereby minimizing environmental footprints in rural areas [Jha et al. 2025].
Explore cooperative ownership arrangements so that local stakeholders gain direct economic and infrastructural benefits from AI-driven verification programs.


Limitations of This Review
 The research presented in this literature review identifies multiple limitations which help explain the obtained results. The review focuses on research conducted before early 2025 because the field of AI-driven carbon credit verification shows rapid development. The authors encountered difficulties when aggregating effectiveness scores because different studies employed various methods to measure success, which required them to synthesize data while making some subjective decisions. The review focused exclusively on technological and ethical aspects while omitting complete examination of carbon market economics and legal frameworks. The research contained publication bias toward positive results together with an English-language and Global North research bias.
The findings need to be read with proper caution because they represent the current state of knowledge from accessible sources up to early  2025. The main trends and research gaps identified in this study demonstrate strong evidence support. Researchers who want to advance this field should update the analysis while investigating new perspectives and regularly testing assumptions because this domain shows rapid development.

Future Directions
Looking ahead, several future directions emerge from our analysis:
Development of Hybrid Human-AI Verification Frameworks: The near future will most likely feature hybrid frameworks that combine human expert input with AI tools instead of fully automated systems. Research and pilot programs need to determine the best way to divide work responsibilities between AI  and human judgment to identify which tasks should remain under human control and which can be safely automated. The  “human-in-the-loop” verification approach should be implemented until AI demonstrates long-term reliability through many years of testing. The frameworks will establish trust because stakeholders understand that AI functions to support expert oversight instead of replacing it.
Standardization and Collaboration:  We foresee (and welcome) enhanced cooperation between technologists, climate scientists, standards organizations, and policymakers to develop standards for digital MRV. This could include standardized data formats, verification protocols that incorporate  AI (with guidance on training, validation, etc.), and certification of software tools. Financial auditing software is an analogy that can be drawn to this, and one could eventually see certified “climate MRV  AI” software that has been rigorously tested and approved for use under certain methodologies. The Climate Chain  Coalition and the WEF’s digital MRV working groups are initiatives that are moving in this direction,  and continued international cooperation will be beneficial.
Capacity Building in Underserved Regions: The digital divide should be addressed by increasing capacity-building initiatives. International climate finance should support training programs and infrastructure development to enable developing country entities to use AI tools. The global sharing of AI MRV  benefits requires both making high-resolution satellite data accessible to everyone and releasing essential algorithms into the public domain because this approach prevents the concentration of benefits among a small number of technology companies and wealthy nations.

Robust Governance and Ethics Frameworks:  Strong governance and ethical frameworks will be needed to guide the future of AI in carbon markets. We can envision the creation of ethical guidelines or requirements similar to an “AI MRV Code of Conduct”  which could be under Global Organisations or voluntary market associations. This would include data privacy, community consent, bias monitoring, etc., and would provide clear expectations for any implementer of AI verification. Such frameworks would not only prevent harm but also give clarity and confidence to those adopting the technology.

Integration with Climate Strategies and Policies:  The integration of digital MRV systems will occur within existing climate strategies and policies as nations revise their  Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The implementation of AI verification systems will make it possible to monitor extensive programs including REDD+ and sectoral crediting mechanisms. We anticipate that digital tools will be mentioned in climate policy documents while governments will dedicate funds to develop these capabilities. AI verification systems have the potential to merge with financial instruments through trigger-based climate finance disbursement which releases funds when  AI-verified metrics demonstrate results. The implementation of results-based and agile climate finance becomes possible through this approach..


Conclusion
The research investigates how artificial intelligence technologies have transformed carbon credit systems by improving their monitoring reporting and verification functions. The analysis of more than 50 studies spanning from 2020 to 2025 shows that AI tools including satellite imagery machine learning, IoT sensors, and blockchain technology are transforming the process of tracking and validating emissions reductions. The individual advantages of these technologies remain limited when used independently to address verification challenges.
The following Figure 6 illustrates how different technologies perform relative to five essential verification challenges, including transparency, fraud prevention, geographical coverage cost efficiency, and data quality.


Figure 6.  AI Technology Effectiveness Across Verification Challenges The Effectiveness scores represent the combined results of the reviewed studies which include both quantitative performance metrics and qualitative assessments.
The analysis demonstrates that machine learning and satellite imagery achieve high effectiveness in terms of geographical coverage and cost efficiency and blockchain technologies excel at improving transparency and tamper-proof verification logs. IoT sensors provide strong advantages through their ability to enhance local data granularity and achieve real-time accuracy although their scope remains limited. 

The implementation of AI technology for carbon credit verification shows potential benefits yet several major restrictions exist. The reliability of AI systems depends on their foundation data and assumptions because many models fail to function well with underrepresented regions or project types. The implementation of biased or inaccurate assessments through these methods creates risks that could compromise climate goals. The verification methods need to prioritize ethical considerations by protecting Indigenous communities while providing fair access to all participants regardless of their size. The verification system's carbon emissions need proper management for the carbon footprint assessment. AI implementation in this field demands constant monitoring together with inclusive design and continuous evaluation to achieve maximum benefits and minimize risk.

The research results present significant implications for all participants in the carbon market. The development of  AI-MRV tools requires project developers and verifiers to acquire new skills which enables them to gain a competitive advantage through verification cost reduction and accuracy improvement. The technology should remain accessible to local communities because developers need to  keep their engagement active to ensure the system serves project objectives and community requirements instead of transforming into an  unapproachable "black box." AI-based verification systems provide credit buyers and regulators with more reliable verified credits. Credit buyers tend to select verified credits with AI-based verification reports and regulators might enforce digital MRV  as a means to enhance their monitoring capabilities. The implementation of hybrid models will become prevalent shortly because AI systems will handle data analysis and anomaly detection while human auditors perform final evaluations of complex cases and handle exceptions. The human-in-the-loop system uses machine efficiency together with human judgment to establish progressive trust in AI systems.
The implementation of AI-driven carbon credit verification stands as an advanced technological solution for climate action. The combination of strict scientific methods with strong ethical principles enables carbon markets to achieve better effectiveness and integrity. The system enables every verified emission reduction to remain authentic and additional while lasting long and working at speeds that match the climate emergency's urgency. These emerging technologies will experience a critical decade of testing growth, and knowledge acquisition. The future success of carbon markets depends on our active response to three critical gaps, which include enhancing data representation for underrepresented regions, investing in transparency and explainability, and developing inclusive governance frameworks. The successful implementation of this vision demands continuous interdisciplinary teamwork along with absolute dedication to ethical standards and flexibility to adjust our approaches based on ongoing deployments of these transformative tools.
 The research findings from this work create the foundation for continuing with the next research phase. The upcoming dissertation will move from analysis to implementation after using the identified opportunities and challenges as its foundation. The following stage will focus on creating a prototype AI-driven verification system that implements all the best practices and mitigation strategies discovered during this review. The system will use satellite data together with machine learning algorithms to boost accuracy while adding explainable features and local data integration mechanisms to minimize bias. The system will undergo empirical testing to measure its functionality and effectiveness in solving the documented research gaps. The transition from theoretical analysis to practical implementation and evaluation serves as a fundamental step to prove the practical advantages of AI-based carbon credit verification methods.  The research directly addresses literature-identified needs by showing how AI-driven MRV processes can become more transparent, trustworthy, and equitable when applied in practice. The practical implementation will generate significant evidence along with important lessons for practitioners and policymakers, which will advance the development of trustworthy and fair carbon markets.

Effectiveness and Limitations
SHAP
The distributive feature of contributions is based on game theory.
High in robustness and faithfulness; computationally intensive (Rane et al., 2024; Wang, 2024)
LIME
Generates local, interpretable models for individual predictions..
Provides clear, local explanations; may lack global interpretability (Islam et al., 2024; Wang, 2024)
Integrated Gradients
Propagates relevance from output to input features.
Robust and faithful; computationally demanding (Bommer et al., 2024)
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
Back-propagates relevance through neural network layers.
Effective for neural networks; complex to implement (Bommer et al., 2024)
Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
Visualizes feature relationships with predictions.
Simple and scalable; lacks depth in complex models (Wang, 2024)
Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) Plots
Visualizes individual conditional expectations.
Provides detailed insights; computationally intensive (Wang, 2024)
Saliency Maps
Highlights influential input features.
Visually intuitive; may oversimplify complex relationships (Thalpage, 2023; Jain, 2024)
Attention Mechanisms
Identifies key input features using attention weights.
Enhances interpretability in neural networks; requires domain knowledge (Jain, 2024)
