Proposal: Carbon Credit Verification SaaS Application
Title:
A Cloud-Based Platform for Carbon Credit Verification Using Satellite Imagery, Explainable AI, Blockchain, and IoT Integration

1. Background & Motivation
As global carbon markets expand, the need for transparent, scalable, and trustworthy carbon credit verification systems becomes urgent. Traditional methods—such as manual field verification—are labor-intensive, costly, and often lack transparency. Recent advancements in satellite imagery, machine learning, and blockchain allow one to automate and standardize the verification process.
This project aims to develop a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that enables users (e.g., carbon project developers, regulators, NGOs) to verify and monitor carbon sequestration activities using remote sensing and AI in an ethical, interpretable, and secure way.

2. Project Objective
To design and implement a prototype SaaS platform that verifies carbon credits based on forest cover change, using satellite imagery analysis powered by explainable AI, secured with blockchain technology, and optionally enhanced with IoT environmental sensor data.

3. Core System Features
A. AI-Powered Satellite Imagery Analysis
Utilizes Sentinel-2 (10m resolution) satellite images to detect changes in forest canopy over time.

Trains a supervised ML model (e.g., U-Net or Random Forest) to classify land cover and detect deforestation or regrowth.

Applies biomass estimation equations to convert land cover changes into approximate carbon sequestration or loss figures.

B. Explainable AI (XAI)
Implements techniques such as:

Feature importance (in tree-based models)

Class Activation Maps (in deep learning)

Ensures users can visually interpret why a change was detected in a certain area.

Builds user trust in AI decisions, particularly for verification audits.

C. Blockchain-Based Transparency
Uses blockchain (e.g., Ethereum or Hyperledger) to:

Timestamp model outputs and verification results.

Prevent tampering or falsification of carbon credit data.

Provide an immutable audit trail for project stakeholders and regulators.

D. IoT Sensor Integration (Optional Feature)
Integrates with soil moisture, temperature, or biomass sensors placed in the project field.

Provides cross-validation of satellite observations with real-time ground data.

Useful in hybrid MRV systems (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification).

E. SaaS Interface
Offers a user-friendly dashboard for:

Uploading or selecting a project area

Viewing carbon estimation maps and change reports

Downloading blockchain-certified verification reports

Supports multiple user roles: developers, validators, and government reviewers.


4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations
Data Privacy: User-submitted data and satellite imagery analysis will comply with GDPR.

Bias Mitigation: Training datasets will cover diverse geographies and forest types to avoid algorithmic bias.

Transparency: All calculations and results will be visible and explainable to end-users.

Sustainability: Encourages responsible AI by highlighting uncertainty zones and discouraging the misuse of automated claims.


5. Technical Stack (Suggested)

6. Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy of land cover classification (IoU, Precision/Recall)

Carbon Estimation Error Margin (compared to reported benchmarks)

User Trust Rating (based on XAI explanations)

System Latency (processing time per analysis job)

Blockchain Integrity (no tampered records)


7. Expected Outcomes
A functional web-based SaaS prototype for verifying carbon credit projects.

A tested AI model capable of detecting forest change and estimating carbon sequestration.

Visual XAI reports explaining model decisions.

Blockchain-secured records of verification outputs.

Optional IoT integration for enriched ground truth support.


8. Timeline (2-Month Plan)

9. Innovation & Contribution
This project combines four modern technologies AI, satellite imaging, blockchain, and IoT into a practical, ethical solution for climate finance accountability. It addresses a real-world need for credible, scalable carbon verification methods and opens the door for future government or NGO adoption.
