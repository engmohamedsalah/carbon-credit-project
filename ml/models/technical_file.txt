## Model Details

- **Model Type**: U-Net
- **Purpose**: Semantic Segmentation for Forest Cover Mapping
- **Data Source**: Sentinel-2
- **Training Script**: `train_forest_change.py`
- **Inference Script**: `predict_forest_change.py`

## Technical Specifications

- **Batch Size**: Reduced to address memory issues
- **Data Loading**: Implemented memory-efficient practices
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Validation**: Best model saved based on validation loss improvements

## Summary of Initial Training

The initial training of the U-Net model encountered memory issues and system hangs, which were resolved by reducing the batch size and implementing memory-efficient data loading practices. A tensor size mismatch error during the forward pass was also addressed by refactoring the U-Net architecture to ensure proper handling of skip connections and upsampling. After these changes, the training script ran successfully for 50 epochs, saving the best model based on validation loss improvements. The model is now ready for evaluation and visualization using the `predict_forest_change.py` script.

## Models to be Trained

1. **Forest Cover Classification (U-Net)**
   - **Type**: Semantic Segmentation
   - **Output**: Pixel-wise classification of forest/non-forest areas
   - **Purpose**: Establishes baseline forest cover
   - **Validation**: Cross-validation with Hansen data

2. **Change Detection (Siamese U-Net)**
   - **Type**: Semantic Segmentation
   - **Output**: Pixel-wise classification of changed/unchanged areas
   - **Purpose**: Identifies areas of deforestation or reforestation
   - **Integration**: Combines Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 results

3. **Time-Series Analysis (ConvLSTM)**
   - **Type**: Classification with temporal dimension
   - **Output**: Pixel-wise classification accounting for seasonal changes
   - **Purpose**: Distinguishes between seasonal changes and actual deforestation
   - **Features**: Temporal pattern recognition, seasonal variation handling, long-term trend analysis

4. **Carbon Estimation**
   - **Type**: Regression
   - **Output**: Estimated carbon sequestration/emission values
   - **Purpose**: Quantifies carbon impact based on forest changes
   - **Inputs**: Forest cover changes, biomass estimates, historical data
