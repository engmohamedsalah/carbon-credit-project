# Technical Documentation: ConvLSTM for Time-Series Forest Analysis

This document details the architecture, development process, challenges, performance, and integration of the `convlstm_fast_final.pth` model.

## 1. Model Architecture: ConvLSTM for Temporal Analysis

The model is a **Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM)** architecture specifically designed for temporal pattern analysis in satellite imagery time series.

### **Architecture Specifications:**
- **Model Type:** ConvLSTM (Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Input Channels:** 4 (R, G, B, NIR bands)
- **Hidden Channels:** [32, 64] (2-layer architecture)
- **Kernel Sizes:** [(3, 3), (3, 3)]
- **Number of Layers:** 2
- **Output Channels:** 1 (binary temporal change classification)
- **Sequence Length:** 3 time steps
- **Patch Size:** 64×64 pixels
- **Total Parameters:** ~2.1M trainable parameters

### **Architecture Components:**
1. **ConvLSTM Cells:** Two stacked ConvLSTM cells that maintain spatial structure while processing temporal sequences
2. **Encoder Path:** Processes 3-step temporal sequences with spatial convolutions
3. **Memory Mechanism:** LSTM gates (input, forget, output, cell) preserve long-term temporal dependencies
4. **Final Convolution:** 1×1 convolution maps final hidden state to binary prediction
5. **Temporal Processing:** Handles seasonal variations and distinguishes real change from natural fluctuations

This architecture was chosen for its ability to capture both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, making it ideal for distinguishing between seasonal forest changes and actual deforestation events.

## 2. Development Journey & Technical Challenges

The ConvLSTM development went through multiple iterations to address scalability, performance, and integration challenges.

### Challenge 1: Massive Dataset Scale and Training Time
- **Problem:** Initial analysis revealed 505,750 patch samples across the dataset, leading to extremely slow training:
  - Original training: 4-5 minutes per batch
  - Estimated training time: 67 hours per epoch (2000+ hours total)
  - Memory requirements exceeded available resources
- **Solution:** Implemented "Fast Training" strategy:
  - Reduced patch size from 128×128 to 64×64 (4x faster processing)
  - Smaller model architecture: 2 layers instead of 3
  - Limited samples per epoch: 2000 training, 500 validation
  - Increased batch size to 8 for efficiency
  - Disabled augmentation for speed
- **Impact:** Training time reduced from days to 17.9 minutes per epoch

### Challenge 2: Severe Class Imbalance in Temporal Data
- **Problem:** Analysis of 655,360 samples revealed 0% positive samples:
  - All patches contained no temporal changes
  - Model learned to predict all negative (100% accuracy, F1=0)
  - Perfect loss reduction but no meaningful learning
- **Root Cause:** Temporal sequences primarily captured seasonal variations rather than actual forest loss events
- **Solution:** Integrated ConvLSTM into ensemble model where it contributes temporal context rather than standalone predictions

### Challenge 3: Memory and Computational Efficiency
- **Problem:** ConvLSTM models are computationally intensive due to:
  - Spatial convolutions at each time step
  - LSTM state maintenance across sequences
  - Large memory footprint for temporal sequences
- **Solution:** Optimized architecture design:
  - Reduced hidden dimensions: [32, 64] instead of [64, 64, 128]
  - Smaller kernel sizes: (3, 3) throughout
  - Efficient batch processing with gradient clipping
  - Memory cleanup between batches

### Challenge 4: Integration with Ensemble System
- **Problem:** ConvLSTM outputs needed to be compatible with other models:
  - Different input channel requirements (4 vs 12 channels)
  - Different temporal vs spatial focus
  - Varying prediction confidence ranges
- **Solution:** Developed ensemble integration strategy:
  - Channel adaptation for multi-modal inputs
  - Weighted contribution based on temporal relevance
  - Confidence-based ensemble weighting
