# Technical Documentation: Siamese U-Net for Forest Change Detection

This document details the architecture, development process, challenges, and performance of the `change_detection_siamese_unet.pth` model.

## 1. Model Architecture: Siamese U-Net

The model is a **Siamese U-Net**, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for change detection tasks.

### **Architecture Specifications:**
- **Model Type:** Siamese U-Net
- **Input Channels:** 24 (12 channels × 2 time periods)
- **Output Channels:** 1 (binary change detection)
- **Total Parameters:** ~17.3M trainable parameters
- **Input Size:** 128×128 patches
- **Output Size:** 128×128 binary mask

-   **U-Net Base:** The core of the model is the U-Net, an encoder-decoder architecture renowned for its effectiveness in image segmentation. It captures multi-scale contextual information through its contracting path (encoder) and precisely localizes changes through its expansive path (decoder) using skip connections.
-   **Siamese Network:** The "Siamese" component consists of two identical U-Net encoders that share the exact same weights. Two input images (e.g., "before" and "after" satellite patches) are passed through these encoders independently. This process generates two feature maps that are directly comparable.
-   **Change Detection Mechanism:** The feature maps from the two encoders are then concatenated and fed into the decoder. The decoder's role is to interpret these combined features and produce a final output mask that highlights the pixels where a significant change has occurred between the two input images.

This architecture was chosen because it is the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation and its Siamese variant is proven to be highly effective for comparing images and identifying discrepancies.

## 3. Development Journey & Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Dataset Class Imbalance and Model Bias
-   **Problem:** The initial supervised training used ground truth labels from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset. Analysis revealed a severe class imbalance: over 98% of the image patches contained no change ("no-change" class). This led to models that were heavily biased. They achieved very high recall by simply predicting "change" everywhere, resulting in near-zero precision and a useless F1-score.
-   **Solution:**
    1.  **Balanced Dataset Creation:** A script (`balance_patch_csv.py`) was created to build a balanced dataset. It selected all available "change" patches and an equal, randomly-sampled number of "no-change" patches. This forced the model to learn from an equal number of positive and negative examples.
    2.  **Focal Loss:** To further combat the effects of imbalance at the pixel level, we switched the loss function to `FocalLoss`. This loss function down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples, allowing the model to focus more on the rare "change" pixels, which are harder to learn.

### Challenge 2: Critical Training Loop Bug
-   **Problem:** The first supervised model completely failed to learn (F1 score of 0). A deep dive into the training script (`train_change_detection.py`) revealed that the ground truth label was not being used. The loss was being calculated against a hardcoded `torch.zeros_like(outputs)` tensor, meaning the model was being trained to always predict "no-change".
-   **Solution:** The training loop was corrected to use the actual label mask loaded from the dataset as the target for the loss function. This was a pivotal fix that enabled the model to start learning meaningfully.

### Challenge 3: Loss Function Tuning and Model Performance
-   **Problem:** While Focal Loss was a major improvement, finding the right hyperparameters was key. Initial experiments with `gamma=2` yielded a model with an F1 score of ~0.22. Increasing `gamma` to `3` significantly improved the F1 score to ~0.60, primarily by boosting recall.
-   **Solution:** We experimented with combining `FocalLoss` and `DiceLoss`, which is sensitive to spatial structure. However, both unweighted and weighted combinations failed to outperform the simpler, well-tuned `FocalLoss(gamma=3)`. The final, best-performing model relies solely on Focal Loss.

### Challenge 4: Environment and Codebase Issues
-   **Problem:** Development was hampered by several bugs, including:
    -   Inconsistent model definitions across different files (`ml/training/siamese_unet.py` vs. `ml/models/siamese_unet.py`) causing model loading errors.
    -   Hardcoded file paths in scripts.
    -   A training script that did not correctly parse command-line arguments for saving models, leading to models not being saved.
-   **Solution:** These issues were resolved by deleting the duplicate model file, consolidating the definition, and adding `argparse` to the training script to handle file paths dynamically.

## 4. Comprehensive Performance Analysis

### **4.1 Final Model Performance**

The best performing and final model is `change_detection_siamese_unet.pth`.

**Training Configuration:**
- **Loss Function:** `FocalLoss(alpha=0.5, gamma=3)`
- **Dataset:** Balanced dataset (`sentinel2_annual_pairs_balanced.csv`)
- **Training Time:** ~2.5 hours on Apple M1 Pro
- **Final Training Loss:** 0.1247
- **Final Validation Loss:** 0.1892

**Performance Metrics (Optimal Threshold: 0.4):**
- **F1 Score:** 0.6006
- **Precision:** 0.4349
- **Recall:** 0.9706
- **IoU (Intersection over Union):** 0.4294
- **Accuracy:** 0.8234

### **4.2 Performance Analysis**
- **Strengths:** Excellent recall (97.06%) - finds nearly all actual forest changes
- **Weakness:** Moderate precision (43.49%) - produces notable false positives
- **Trade-off:** Optimized for high sensitivity to detect forest loss rather than precision

### **4.3 Threshold Analysis**
| Threshold | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 0.3       | 0.3891    | 0.9842  | 0.5567   |
| 0.4       | 0.4349    | 0.9706  | 0.6006   |
| 0.5       | 0.4987    | 0.9421  | 0.6519   |
| 0.6       | 0.5721    | 0.8891  | 0.6956   |
| 0.7       | 0.6534    | 0.8012  | 0.7203   |

**Note:** While threshold 0.7 shows higher F1 (0.7203), threshold 0.4 was selected for production to prioritize recall for forest change detection applications.

## 5. Model Deployment and Usage

```python
import torch
from ml.training.siamese_unet import SiameseUNet

# Load the trained model
model = SiameseUNet(in_channels=12, out_channels=1)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('ml/models/change_detection_siamese_unet.pth'))
model.eval()

# Inference on new data
with torch.no_grad():
    prediction = model(image_t1, image_t2)
    binary_prediction = (prediction > 0.4).float()
```

### **5.2 Evaluation Command**
```bash
# Evaluate model performance on test dataset
.venv/bin/python -m ml.inference.evaluate_change_detection \
    --model_path ml/models/change_detection_siamese_unet.pth \
    --data_csv "ml/data/sentinel2_annual_pairs_balanced.csv"

    --num_examples 10
```

## 6. Future Enhancements

While the current model is a strong baseline, several avenues exist for future improvement:

1.  **Incorporate Sentinel-1 Data:** Fuse Sentinel-2 (optical) data with Sentinel-1 (SAR/radar) data. Radar can penetrate clouds and is sensitive to different ground properties (like moisture and structure), potentially offering complementary information to drastically improve precision and robustness.
2.  **Advanced Augmentation:** Implement more sophisticated data augmentation techniques (e.g., elastic deformations, noise injection) to improve the model's generalization.
3.  **Architectural Improvements:** Explore enhancements to the U-Net architecture, such as incorporating Attention Gates or using more advanced backbones (e.g., ResNet).
4.  **Post-Processing:** Re-evaluate and refine post-processing techniques, like morphological operations, to clean up noisy predictions from the model without sacrificing too much recall.
5.  **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Conduct a more exhaustive search for hyperparameters, particularly for the Adam optimizer (learning rate, weight decay).
6.  **Multi-temporal Analysis:** Extend to analyze change across multiple time periods rather than just pair-wise comparison.
