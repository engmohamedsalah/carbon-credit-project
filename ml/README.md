## Hansen Global Forest Change Data

The Hansen Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset provides global, high-resolution (30m) maps of forest cover and change. The following layers are used in this project and are clipped to the AOI:

- **treecover2000**: Percent tree canopy cover for the year 2000 (0â€“100). Used as a baseline for forest extent.
- **lossyear**: Year of forest loss per pixel (0 = no loss, 1 = loss in 2001, 2 = loss in 2002, ..., 23 = loss in 2023).
- **gain**: Forest gain (2000â€“2012), binary (1 = gain, 0 = no gain).
- **datamask**: Data quality mask (1 = mapped land, 2 = water, 0 = no data).

All layers are stored as GeoTIFFs in `ml/data/hansen_downloads/` and are spatially aligned to the project AOI. These layers are used for:
- Generating training labels for change detection
- Providing ground truth for model validation
- Establishing historical forest baselines
