# Model Purposes and Predictions - Carbon Credit Verification System

This document explains the purpose of each of the 4 models in simple terms with practical examples.

## 🌳 **Simple Explanation of the 4 Models**

Think of it like having **4 different experts** looking at satellite photos of forests to verify carbon credits:

## 🔮 **What Each Model Predicts**

### **1. Forest Cover Model (The Forest Mapper) 🗺️**

**What it predicts:** "Is this pixel forest or not forest?"

**Simple Purpose:** "Where are the forests?"
- Looks at a satellite photo and colors all the forest areas green
- Like having someone circle all the trees on a map
- **Goal:** Count how much forest area exists

**Technical Details:**
- **Input:** 12-channel Sentinel-2 satellite image (64×64 pixels)
- **Output:** Binary prediction (Forest = 1, Non-forest = 0)
- **Performance:** F1=0.4911, Precision=0.4147, Recall=0.6022

**Real Example:**
```
Input: Satellite image of Amazon rainforest region
Prediction: 
- Pixel (10,15): Forest = 0.85 → Predicted as Forest ✅
- Pixel (25,30): Forest = 0.23 → Predicted as Non-forest ✅
- Pixel (40,45): Forest = 0.67 → Predicted as Forest ✅

Result: "This 64×64 pixel area contains 75% forest coverage"
```

**Use Case Example:**
A company claims they have 1000 hectares of forest for carbon credits. This model analyzes satellite images and confirms: "Actually, only 750 hectares are forest, 250 hectares are farmland."

### **2. Change Detection Model (The Change Spotter) 🔍**

**What it predicts:** "Did this area change between two time periods?"

**Simple Purpose:** "What changed between two photos?"
- Compares two photos taken months apart
- Spots where forests disappeared or new forests grew
- Like playing "spot the difference" with satellite images
- **Goal:** Find where forests were cut down or planted

**Technical Details:**
- **Input:** Two 12-channel Sentinel-2 images (before & after, 128×128 pixels)
- **Output:** Binary change prediction (Changed = 1, No change = 0)
- **Performance:** F1=0.6006, Precision=0.4349, Recall=0.9706

**Real Example:**
```
Input: 
- Image 1 (January 2023): Dense forest area
- Image 2 (June 2023): Same area with clearing

Prediction:
- Pixel (20,25): Change = 0.95 → "Forest was cut down here" ✅
- Pixel (50,60): Change = 0.12 → "No change detected" ✅
- Pixel (35,40): Change = 0.78 → "Deforestation occurred" ✅

Result: "15% of this area experienced deforestation"
```

**Use Case Example:**
A carbon credit project claims no deforestation occurred in their protected area. This model compares January vs December satellite images and finds: "Actually, 50 hectares of forest were cleared in March."

### **3. ConvLSTM Model (The Season Expert) 📅**

**What it predicts:** "Will this area have forest change based on temporal patterns?"

**Simple Purpose:** "Is this real change or just seasons?"
- Looks at many photos over time (3-step sequences)
- Knows that trees lose leaves in winter but grow back in spring
- Separates real deforestation from natural seasonal changes
- **Goal:** Make sure we don't count autumn leaf loss as deforestation

**Technical Details:**
- **Input:** 3-step temporal sequence (4-channel images, 64×64 pixels)
- **Output:** Temporal change probability with seasonal context
- **Performance:** Functional (provides temporal context to ensemble)

**Real Example:**
```
Input: Time series of forest area
- March 2023: Dense green forest
- June 2023: Slightly less green (dry season)
- September 2023: Green again (wet season)

Prediction:
- Temporal Pattern: "Seasonal variation detected"
- Real Change: 0.15 → "No permanent deforestation"
- Confidence: 0.87 → "High confidence this is natural"

Result: "This is seasonal change, not deforestation"
```

**Use Case Example:**
The Change Detection model flags an area as "deforested" because trees lost leaves in autumn. The ConvLSTM model analyzes the temporal pattern and corrects: "This is just seasonal leaf loss, trees will regrow in spring."

### **4. Ensemble Model (The Final Judge) ⚖️**

**What it predicts:** "Final forest change prediction + carbon impact"

**Simple Purpose:** "What's the final answer?"
- Takes advice from all 3 experts above
- Combines their opinions to make the best decision
- Calculates exactly how much carbon was gained or lost
- **Goal:** Give the final, most accurate answer for carbon credits

**Technical Details:**
- **Input:** Combines predictions from all 3 models
- **Output:** Final prediction + carbon impact (tons CO₂)
- **Performance:** Expected F1 > 0.6 (25% improvement over individual models)
- **Methods:** Weighted average, conditional, stacked ensemble

**Real Example:**
```
Input Predictions:
- Forest Cover: "75% forest coverage"
- Change Detection: "20% area changed"
- ConvLSTM: "50% is seasonal, 50% is real change"

Ensemble Calculation:
- Real deforestation: 20% × 50% = 10% of area
- Forest area lost: 1000 hectares × 10% = 100 hectares
- Carbon impact: 100 hectares × 150 tons/hectare = 15,000 tons CO₂

Final Prediction: "15,000 tons of carbon lost due to deforestation"
```

**Use Case Example:**
A carbon credit verification request comes in. The ensemble model processes all data and delivers: "Based on satellite analysis, this project has sequestered 25,000 tons of CO₂ with 95% confidence. Verified for carbon credit trading."

## 🎯 **Complete Workflow Example**

**Scenario:** Verifying a reforestation project in Brazil

### **Step 1: Forest Mapping**
```
Forest Cover Model analyzes current satellite image:
→ "Project area contains 800 hectares of forest out of 1000 hectares total"
```

### **Step 2: Change Detection**
```
Change Detection Model compares 2020 vs 2023 images:
→ "600 hectares of new forest growth detected since project started"
```

### **Step 3: Temporal Validation**
```
ConvLSTM Model analyzes monthly images 2020-2023:
→ "Growth pattern is consistent with tree planting, not seasonal variation"
```

### **Step 4: Final Verification**
```
Ensemble Model combines all predictions:
→ "Verified: 600 hectares of new forest = 90,000 tons CO₂ sequestered"
→ "Confidence: 92% - Approved for carbon credit trading"
```

## 💡 **Why We Need All 4 Models?**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **One model might make mistakes** | Four models cross-check each other |
| **Seasonal changes confuse detection** | ConvLSTM filters out seasonal effects |
| **Need precise carbon calculations** | Ensemble provides most accurate results |
| **Different expertise needed** | Each model specializes in different aspects |

## 🚀 **Real-World Applications**

### **Carbon Credit Trading**
- **Input:** Satellite images of forest project
- **Output:** "Verified 50,000 tons CO₂ sequestered - Ready for trading"

### **Deforestation Monitoring**

- **Output:** "Alert: 25 hectares illegally cleared in sector 7"

### **Reforestation Verification**
- **Input:** Before/after images of restoration project
- **Output:** "Confirmed: 200 hectares successfully reforested"

### **Government Reporting**
- **Input:** National forest satellite data
- **Output:** "Annual forest loss: 0.5% (within sustainable limits)"
